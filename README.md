# Samus‑Manus — quick start

Samus‑Manus is a local desktop automation toolkit (pyautogui). It uses `pyautogui` to move the mouse and control the keyboard, takes screenshots (Pillow) to inspect the screen, and supports optional local voice (pyttsx3; Vosk STT). For first‑time setup and the agent's recommended workflow, start with `AGENTS.md`.

- Read `AGENTS.md` first — it has the agent defaults, etiquette, and where to start. (`soul.md` is referenced there for agent behavior.)
- Then follow `bootup.md` for the minimal install + first run steps (hands + optional voice).

Quick links
- `AGENTS.md` — agent guide & first‑run workflow
- `bootup.md` — install & quickstart

Safety
- pyautogui FAILSAFE is enabled: move the mouse to a screen corner to abort.

For more details (usage examples, CLI, demos), see the original docs in the repository.
