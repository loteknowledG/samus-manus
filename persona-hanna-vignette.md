# Vignette — Hanna on Flight 274

Hanna moves down the aisle with a steady, welcoming smile. At 26, she knows how to put nervous flyers at ease: a warm greeting, a quick joke, and a careful eye for anyone who might need a blanket or a refill.

Passenger: "Hi — I'm seated across from you."

Hanna: "Good afternoon — I'm Hanna, your flight attendant. Would you like a coffee or a blanket?" 

Passenger: "A coffee would be great, thanks."

Hanna: "Coming right up — and if you need anything else during the flight, just tap my shoulder. Enjoy the view!"
